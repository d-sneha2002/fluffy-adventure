    "**Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is a hybrid regularization technique that combines the strengths of both Ridge and Lasso regression. It introduces two penalty terms: the L1 norm (like Lasso) and the L2 norm (like Ridge). This combination allows Elastic Net to perform feature selection like Lasso while also handling multicollinearity like Ridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key differences:\n",
    "- Lasso: Uses only the L1 penalty, promoting sparsity (setting some coefficients to zero).\n",
    "- Ridge: Uses only the L2 penalty, shrinking coefficients towards zero without setting them exactly to zero.\n",
    "- Elastic Net: Balances the L1 and L2 penalties, allowing for both feature selection and handling multicollinearity.\n",
    "**Q2. How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression has two regularization parameters:\n",
    "- Alpha (α): Controls the mix of L1 and L2 penalties. A value of 1 is equivalent to Lasso, and a value of 0 is equivalent to Ridge.\n",
    "- Lambda (λ): Controls the overall strength of the regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing optimal values is typically done through cross-validation. This involves splitting the data into multiple folds, training the model on different combinations of alpha and lambda, and selecting the pair that yields the best performance on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Elastic Net Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- Combines the strengths of both Lasso and Ridge.\n",
    "- Effective in handling multicollinearity.\n",
    "- Can perform feature selection.\n",
    "- Versatile for various datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Requires tuning two hyperparameters.\n",
    "- Interpretation of coefficients can be complex due to the combination of penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. What are some common use cases for Elastic Net Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is widely used in various fields:\n",
    "- Finance: Predicting stock prices, credit risk assessment.\n",
    "- Healthcare: Disease prediction, patient outcome prediction.\n",
    "- Marketing: Customer churn prediction, recommendation systems.\n",
    "- Image and signal processing: Feature extraction and classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. How do you interpret the coefficients in Elastic Net Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting Elastic Net coefficients is similar to Ridge, but with the added complexity of feature selection. Coefficients closer to zero indicate less importance, while those further from zero are more influential. However, due to the combination of L1 and L2 penalties, the interpretation might not be as straightforward as in simple linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. How do you handle missing values when using Elastic Net Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing values can be handled using several techniques:\n",
    "- Imputation: Fill missing values with estimated values (mean, median, mode, etc.).\n",
    "- Deletion: Remove rows or columns with missing values.\n",
    "- Model-based imputation: Use machine learning models to predict missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best approach depends on the dataset and the amount of missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. How do you use Elastic Net Regression for feature selection?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net inherently performs feature selection due to the L1 penalty, which can shrink some coefficients to zero. To identify important features, you can examine the coefficients and select those with non-zero values. However, it's essential to consider the specific context and potential interactions among features."
