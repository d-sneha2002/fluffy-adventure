1. Who developed Python Programming Language?
Guido van Rossum

2. Which type of Programming does Python support?
Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Imperative Programming
Functional Programming
Procedural Programming   

3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?
Yes, Python is case-sensitive when dealing with identifiers. This means that variables, function names, and other identifiers with different capitalization are treated as distinct.   

4. What is the correct extension of the Python file?
The correct extension for Python files is ".py".

5. Is Python code compiled or interpreted?
Python is an interpreted language. This means that the code is executed line by line by the Python interpreter, without requiring a separate compilation step.

6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language?
Python uses indentation to define code blocks. There are no specific keywords like curly braces in other languages. Common code blocks include:
Function definitions (using the def keyword)
Class definitions (using the class keyword)
Conditional statements (using if, elif, and else)
Loops (using for and while)

7. State a character used to give single-line comments in Python?
The hash symbol (#) is used for single-line comments in Python.

8. Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?
We can use the following built-in functions to determine the Python version:
sys.version: Returns a string containing information about the Python version.
platform.python_version(): Returns a string representing the Python version.

9. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called
Lambda

10. What does pip stand for python?
PIP stands for "Pip Installs Packages". It is the package installer for Python.

11. Mention a few built-in functions in python?
Python has numerous built-in functions. Here are a few examples:
print(): Prints values to the console.
len(): Returns the length of an object (like a string or list).
type(): Returns the data type of an object.
range(): Generates a sequence of numbers.
input(): Takes user input.

12. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?
There is no officially defined maximum length for identifiers in Python. However, it's generally recommended to keep them reasonably short for readability.

13. What are the benefits of using Python?
Python offers several advantages:
Readability: Python's syntax is clean and easy to understand.
Versatility: It can be used for various applications (web development, data science, machine learning, etc.)
Large community and extensive libraries: A vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks is available.
Cross-platform compatibility: Python code can run on different operating systems.

14. How is memory managed in Python?
Python employs garbage collection for memory management. This means that the Python interpreter automatically reclaims memory that is no longer in use.

15. How to Install Python on Windows and set path variables?
To install Python on Windows:
Download the appropriate installer from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/.
Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
Check the option to "Add Python 3.x to PATH" during installation.
To set path variables manually:
Right-click on "This PC" and select "Properties".
Click on "Advanced system settings".
In the "Advanced" tab, click on "Environment Variables".
Under "System variables", find the "Path" variable and edit it.   
Add the path to your Python installation directory (e.g., C:\Python310) to the list of paths.

16. Is indentation required in python?
Yes, indentation is crucial in Python. It defines code blocks and is essential for the language's syntax. Consistent indentation (usually four spaces) is used to group statements together.
