    "**Q1. What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "- It defines the probability of a discrete random variable taking on a specific value.\n",
    "- Used for discrete random variables.\n",
    "- Example: Probability of getting a specific number when rolling a dice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "- It defines the probability density for a continuous random variable over a specific range.\n",
    "- Used for continuous random variables.\n",
    "- Example: Probability of a person's height falling within a specific range.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cumulative Density Function (CDF):\n",
    "- Gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value.   \n",
    "- Used for both discrete and continuous random variables.\n",
    "- Example: Probability that a student's height is less than or equal to 170 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "CDF is used to:\n",
    "- Calculate probabilities for ranges of values.\n",
    "- Compare probability distributions.\n",
    "- Find percentiles and quantiles.\n",

    "**Q3. What are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model? Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Normal Distribution:\n",
    "- Heights of people\n",
    "- IQ scores\n",
    "- Measurement errors\n",
    "- Stock prices\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "- Mean (µ): Determines the center of the distribution.\n",
    "- Standard deviation (σ): Controls the spread of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "A larger standard deviation results in a wider curve, while a smaller standard deviation leads to a narrower curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Explain the importance of Normal Distribution. Give a few real-life examples of Normal Distribution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance of Normal Distribution:\n",
    "- Many natural phenomena follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "- Statistical methods often assume normality.\n",

    "**Q5. What is Bernoulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli Distribution:\n",
    "Models a single trial with two possible outcomes (success or failure).   \n",
    "Example: Flipping a coin once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference:\n",
    "Bernoulli distribution is for a single trial, while binomial distribution is for multiple trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. Consider a dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. If we assume that the dataset is normally distributed, what is the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60? Use the appropriate formula and show your calculations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate this, we need to standardize the value using the z-score formula:\n",
    "- z = (x - μ) / σ\n",
    "- z = (60 - 50) / 10 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a z-table or statistical software, we find the probability of Z > 1 is approximately 0.1587.\n",
    "Therefore, the probability of a randomly selected observation being greater than 60 is approximately 15.87%.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. Explain uniform Distribution with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform Distribution: A probability distribution where all outcomes are equally likely.\n",

    "**Q8. What is the z score? State the importance of the z score.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-score:\n",
    "- A standardized value that measures the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean.\n",
    "- Important for comparing values from different distributions and for calculating probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q9. What is Central Limit Theorem? State the significance of the Central Limit Theorem.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Central Limit Theorem (CLT): CLT states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Significance:\n",
    "- Allows us to make inferences about population parameters based on sample statistics.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The sample size should be sufficiently large (usually n >= 30).\n",
    "- The samples should be independently and randomly selected.\n",
    "- The population distribution should have a finite variance."
