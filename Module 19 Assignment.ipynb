    "The close() function is crucial for proper file handling in Python. It serves two primary purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Releasing System Resources\n",
    "File handles: When a file is opened, the operating system allocates a file handle to manage it. This handle consumes system resources.\n",
    "Memory: The file's contents might be cached in memory for performance reasons. Closing the file releases this memory back to the system.\n",
    "By closing a file, you free up these resources for other processes or applications to use.\n",

    "2. Ensuring Data Integrity\n",
    "Writing data: When you write data to a file, it's often buffered in memory before being physically written to the disk. Closing the file forces any remaining data in the buffer to be written to the disk, ensuring data integrity.\n",
